# Mukta Vaani Sans

[Mukta Vaani](https://github.com/EkType/Mukta) is a Gujarati typeface designed by EkType. Mukta Vaani Sans is the modified version of the original Mukta Vaani typeface. The major difference is the curve at the end of the terminals.

There are few small changes in design compare to the original typeface. This version includes many more conjuncts and is compiled with the latest font development technology (Google's fontmake). This release also contains variable typeface files. Variable font technology is relatively new; many software does not support it yet, especially for Indic scripts. In my testing, the variable font files work flawlessly on the web. You could transition smoothly between weights. Adobe software has mixed experience.
